        <p class="pBBUR">Research, if I’m honest, was a word that just sounded boring to me. I mean if someone ever asked me, “Hey Rich, do you want to come and conduct some research with us?” My answer would probably have been, “How ‘bout no.” I never thought of someone being both a Researcher and a Designer…in my mind those were two very different personalities.<br><br>So when I started my first project at BLOC, and discovered that I needed to create a survey, and do some competitive analysis, my mindset was, “Can we just pretend we did the research, and get to the designing?” The funny thing is that by the time I got to my last project with BLOC, I couldn’t wait to see what the responses would be to my survey, and I couldn’t wait to start designing something around the results! Blocbox, was my introduction to the design process, and the beginning of a deeper appreciation for quality design everywhere. It began with Google Forms, and reaching a small group of people familiar with cloud based storage, and its capabilities.

      <p class="pBBUR">It wasn’t until I got the results back from my survey that it really clicked for me just how helpful a survey can be to a design. Right away I could see trends with how people were browsing online, bookmarking, what they were saving, and how they used it for collaboration. <br><br>After analyzing these results, I created User Personas for a quick snapshot of who I would be designing for.</p>
