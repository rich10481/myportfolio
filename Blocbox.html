        <h2 class="blue">User Research</h2>
        <p class="pBB">Research, if I’m honest, was a word that just sounded boring to me. I mean if someone ever said, “Hey Rich, come and conduct some research with us.” My response would probably be, “How ‘bout no.” I never thought of someone being both a Researcher and a Designer…in my mind those were two very different personalities.<br><br>So when I started my first project at BLOC, and discovered that I needed to create a <a class="hyperlink" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fR0fUXjqg8vxi7flGt70_fIJOqHsoQ1TyHTMs2-dkbs/viewanalytics">survey</a>, and do some competitive analysis, my mindset was, “Can we just pretend we did the research, and get to the designing?” The funny thing is that by the time I got to my last project with BLOC, I couldn’t wait to see what the responses would be to my survey, and I couldn’t wait to start designing something around the results! Blocbox, was my introduction to the design process, and the beginning of a deeper appreciation for quality design everywhere. It began with Google Forms, and reaching a small group of people familiar with cloud based storage, and its capabilities.

    <div class="DarkGray">
      <p class="pBB">It wasn’t until I got the results back from my survey that it really clicked for me just how helpful a survey can be to a design. Right away I could see trends with how people were browsing online, bookmarking, what they were saving, and how they used it for collaboration. <br><br>After analyzing these results, I created User Personas for a quick snapshot of who I would be designing for.</p>

      <h2 class="blue">Competitive Analysis</h2>
       <p class="pBB">I learned from my survey that 56% of my respondents used Dropbox for their cloud storage, and the rest were evenly divided between Google Drive, and iCloud. It was time to take a closer look at what Dropbox was doing right, and where there were opportunities to possibly gain some of their market share.</p>
       <img id="CAimg" src="Images/Blocbox/BBCompetitiveAnalysis.png" alt="Competitive Analysis Doc">
       <p class="pBB">Analyzing the competition really helped bring to light how Blocbox could enter the market with a fresh offering. Now it was time to brand Blocbox.</p>

      <h2 class="gray">Branding</h2>
       <p class="pGray">And the fun begins! Blocbox was the first logo I’d ever created, and this was another introduction to  a process that works, a process I could fall back on for any logo design going forward. It started with a mind-map, and I decided to start with the words, ‘organize’ and ‘collaborate.’ ‘Organize’ brought me to think of file folders, and ‘collaborate’ led me to ‘ideas,’ which led me to an image of a light bulb.</p>
       <img id="BBsketches" src="Images/Blocbox/BBlogosketches.png">
       <p class="pGray">At this point I liked the hands drawing the light bulb in a box because I felt that it really communicated the collaboration piece, but the more I thought about what the heart of the service was, collaboration was just a piece of it. After discussing logos with my mentor, and reviewing different logos of major brands, it was clear I was trying to fit too much into a symbol. I decided to go back to the basics of the service, and the thought just hit me to create a box out of two file folders. It was simple, and it hinted at the heart of the service provided. </p>
       <img id="BBLogo1" src="Images/Blocbox/Blocbox_Logo.jpg">
       <p class="pGray">I was really proud of my logo at this stage, but my mentor challenged me to shrink it down and see how much detail was left. He also challenged me to remove the outlines around the folders, so that I wouldn't have to change the color of the outline based on whatever background was behind it.  The result, was the final logo for Blocbox. </p>
       <img id="BBLogo2" src="Images/Blocbox/Blocbox_Final_Logo.jpg">
       <p class="pGray">The next step was to choose my fonts and colors to use on the web site. Using Adobe Color, I landed on shades of teal to give Blocbox a professional, and bright feel. I chose Roboto Slab as the Display Font because I thought the "boxiness" of it paired well with the name and logo.</p>

      <div class="LightGray">
       <h2 class="blue">User Flows</h2>
       <p class="pBB">Since Blocbox would not be a fully-functional web site, I wrote the user flows to reflect only the primary functions of the service. Once I had identified those functions, I was left with a clear map to start wireframing.</p>
