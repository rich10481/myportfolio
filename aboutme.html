              <p> I'm the guy who doesn't stop until it's fixed. This is how I ended up here, learning web design, and all. My career life was broken, and I wrestled with it for a while, until I finally realized the problem: I was doing everything but what I loved. It's an easy trap to get into when you're young and you have a beautiful girl by your side that wants to get married. It's quite a bit harder to get out of that routine when the bills keep coming, and you've got two kids added to the mix, but I'm persistent, and I'm fixing my career life. </p>

            <div class="tab-content">
              <p>I like to make things. When I was a kid I loved to play with legos, draw, and play the air guitar and shout "Born in the USA!" I love to write songs, and make music, and I love designing logos, web sites, and sermon graphics for my church. I even enjoy cooking, and my wife appreciates that.</p>

              <p> Henry Ward Beecher said, "In this world, it is not what we take up, but what we give up, that makes us rich." I want to give much in every aspect of my life. I want my wife to always be able to say that I loved, and served her. I want my kids to always know that I value them, and believe in them. I want my employer to know that I'm giving everything I've got to give to every task. </p>
