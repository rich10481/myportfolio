         <h2 class="blue">Competitive Analysis</h2>
         <p class="pBB">Paycrave was my second project with BLOC, and was a period of significant growth for me in designing mobile apps. Prior to this I had completed a few less involved iOS and Android designs using Sketch, but for Paycrave I would design every aspect of the app, which required a lot more attention and detail. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Paycrave would be an iOS app that helps users find food trucks nearby, enables them to order, pay, view order history, and review trucks. There was no time for research on this one, so I jumped into the Competitve Analysis.
        <br>
        <br>
        I began by running a search through the Apple App Store and found three competitors to analyze: Food Truck Finder USA, HNGR, and Roaming Hunger. Out of these three apps, the only one offering a service that Paycrave aimed to offer was HNGR, which was also the one with the most modern design, so I downloaded this app and tested it as much as it would let me. Below is a quick competitive analysis I put together.

         <h2 class="blue">Branding</h2>
         <p class="pBB">
         After taking a good look at the competition I felt ready to start designing Paycrave. I chose to keep the color scheme that Bloc provided for the project because I thought red and green worked well for a food app. I already had a logo in mind, so I put together a very simple idea in Illustrator and revised it from there.

         <p class="pBB">
         This logo passed the test of size, but still had room for improvement. After discussing how it could improve with my mentor, I knew what to do. Below is the final logo for Paycrave.

        <h2 class="blue">Wireframing</h2>
         <p class="pBB">
         With the logo ready and the competitive analysis done, it was time to start wireframing with Balsamiq. Wireframing really helps me to start prioritizing things like what buttons really should be on the first page of the application, where certain buttons should be placed, and how large sections should be. I made a lot of adjustments from this phase, but this was the start of the design.
         </p>
         <img id="PCWireframes" src="Images/PAYCRAVE/PCWireframes.png" alt="PC Wireframes">
         <p class="pBB">
         After discussing the wireframes with my mentor I had some ideas to strengthen the design, and I was excited to start implementing them in Sketch.

          <h2 class="blue">Hi-Fi Wireframing</h2>
          <p class="pBB">
          I designed the Hi-Fi Wireframes using Sketch, and although there are some things I would change now, I think the app came out pretty strong for my first complete design of an iOS app. The three screens below were my favorites out of the designs.</p>

          <p class="pBB">
          After I had completed my designs, it was time to test them out and see if users could easily navigate through the app and accomplish the tasks it was designed for. I set up a clickable prototype in inVision, and made some phone calls to have my friends test it out. The results were positive, which was good, because I needed to get to my next project.
